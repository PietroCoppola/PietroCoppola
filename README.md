## Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a multinational Carnegie Mellon SCS undergrad looking to explore the horizons of CS a bit, learning as much as I can from as many brilliant CMU scholars as possible. Some of my tech interests include ML, HCI/Edtech, Fintech, and Gamedev. Right now I'm working on mastering a fourth _natural_ language and a couple more _programming_ languages.
