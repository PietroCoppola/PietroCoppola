## Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a multi Carnegie Mellon SCS undergrad looking to explore the horizons of CS a bit, learning as much as I can from as many brilliant CMU scholars as possible. My current tech interests include ML, Human-Computer Interaction, Robotics and Gamedev. 

Working on mastering a fourth _natural_ language and a couple more _programming_ languages. Also, I'm currently doing some research on the world of GAI and the challenges of training these models when so much of the available data is AI-generated (like model collapse!).
